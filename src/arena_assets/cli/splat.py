HELP = """Turn a trained 3D Gaussian splat into an object bundle for Isaac Sim. By default it frames a wall capture that wall kinds place with 'model: NAME'. With --object it frames a free-standing object that worlds and scenarios place like any other object.

SOURCE is a USD file with ParticleField prims, as 3DGRUT writes with export_usd.enabled=true. OUT_DIR receives NAME.gaussians.usdc (the kept Gaussians), NAME.usda (a Z-up wrapper in meters that carries the registration), annotation.yaml and, with --collider-mesh, NAME.collider.obj plus NAME.sdf/ (a collision-only model for Gazebo).

Target frame (registration, crop and --drop), meters, Z up. Wall frame: origin at the base midpoint of the captured wall, X along the wall, Y facing into the room, Y = 0 on the captured wall plane. Object frame (--object): origin on the floor under the object center, X and Y level, Y toward the object front.

Registration, exactly one of --matrix (a known transform) or --points (fit one from point pairs, prints the fitted scale and the RMS residual).

Crop, in the target frame: X from -width/2 to +width/2 and Z from --floor to --height. Y runs from -behind to --depth for a wall and from -depth/2 to +depth/2 for an object. Anything that should stay must be wholly inside the crop, take the rest out with --drop.

Captured geometry is seen by lidar and depth cameras but has no collision of its own. A wall crop therefore keeps 5 cm in front of the captured wall plane by default and deeper crops are opt-in. An object is visual only and physics ignores it, annotation.yaml records the crop as its bounding box.

Collision is optional: --collider-mesh takes a triangle mesh of the same capture (.obj or .ply, in the source stage frame, for example a surface reconstructed from the training views). It is registered and cropped like the Gaussians and baked into NAME.usda as an invisible static mesh collider, so in Isaac robots stop at it while cameras and lidar keep seeing the splat. Gazebo gets it through NAME.sdf, which holds only the collision, and annotation.yaml names the plain mesh NAME.collider.obj. 'arena-assets collider' replaces or removes the collider later.

Bundle origin: for a wall, the wall base midpoint at the BACK of the crop, which is the wall frame shifted by +behind along Y. The physical wall of the wall kind sits there, so the whole capture lies in front of it. With --behind B the captured wall surface stands B meters in front of the physical wall. For an object, the object frame origin, so a pose at floor height stands it on the floor.

Next: check the printed counts, then publish with 'arena asset push object NAME'."""
