# Importing upstream datasets

`arena asset import` converts items of public datasets into Arena items: objects, materials, worlds, scenarios, benchmark suites, sounds and recorded episodes. An imported item lands in the imported root and resolves like a local one, with an `ATTRIBUTION.yaml` naming where it came from. The registry in [importers/__init__.py](src/arena_assets/importers/__init__.py) is authoritative for the sources, their kinds and their license verdicts.

## Usage

```sh
arena asset import                                   # registered sources by kind, with license verdict and host
arena asset import object                            # sources of one kind
arena asset import object gso                        # item ids of one source
arena asset import object gso Cole_Hardware_Hammer_Black
arena asset import world procthor val/0 val/1        # several items
arena asset import world barn --all                  # every item of a source
arena asset import object gso <item> --out ./gso     # another target root
```

Over MCP, the `assets` domain offers the same: `assets_import_sources` lists the datasets, `assets_import_items` one dataset's item ids (with a glob and a limit), and `assets_import` converts chosen items as a job whose result lists the item paths. `--json` prints either listing as JSON.

`arena asset import` is the Arena CLI front of `arena-assets import KIND SOURCE ITEM... [-o OUT]`, which works the same outside Arena. Tab completion of `arena asset import KIND SOURCE` offers the source's item ids.

## How an import works

Importers are registered by kind and source, so one source can serve several kinds (`import world barn 17` is one challenge world, `import suite barn barn` the whole benchmark). Each item is fetched into the source's cache under `$ARENA_ASSETS_DIR/.import/SOURCE`, converted into the kind's directory layout under the target root and marked with an `ATTRIBUTION.yaml` (`source`, `url`, `license`, `authors`, `citation`).

The default target is the imported root, `$ARENA_ASSETS_DIR_IMPORTED`, else `$ARENA_ASSETS_DIR/_imported`, with worlds and the scenarios that bring their world under its `worlds/`. The resolvers of every kind read it after the curated local root, so an imported item resolves like any local one.

A bare `import KIND SOURCE` caches the source's item list in `$ARENA_ASSETS_DIR/.import/SOURCE/items.KIND.json`, for 24 h when the host's listing can change (Fuel, Dataverse) and for good when the source is pinned to a revision, and shows the old list when the host fails. Tab completion reads the same file and starts the listing in the background when the file is missing or expired. A download that gets a 5xx, 408 or 429 answer, no answer within 30 s, a dropped connection or a short body is tried four times with a doubling pause before the import fails.

The license verdict of a source is `yes` (usable as is, attribution where the license asks for it), `nc` (non-commercial), `sa` (share-alike), `no`, or `unclear` (the upstream terms are missing or rest on data under unknown terms). A source that takes only some licenses refuses an item under any other.

Object sources are staged as a dataset and run through the same `arena-assets db build` as native objects (`formats=usdz,sdf,fbx` plus `previews`), so they need the [Blender worker](README.md#installation) and the `db` extra, and `OUT/Common` is a queryable database. Object and material builds fit every texture into 2048 px on its longer side (the `max-texture` build option). Material sources need no Blender.

## Objects

Every object source writes `Common/Object/<item>` with the `usdz`, `sdf` and `fbx` models, previews, an `annotation.yaml` tagged `origin::<source>` and its attribution.

### gso

[Google Scanned Objects](https://app.gazebosim.org/GoogleResearch/fuel/models) from Gazebo Fuel, about 1k scanned household objects under CC BY 4.0. The item id is the Fuel model name (`import object gso Cole_Hardware_Hammer_Black`). An item stages the one mesh the model's SDF shows with the scale, pose and albedo map the SDF gives it, rewritten into the axes the builder's importer expects. The annotation takes the semantic fixes of [semantic](src/arena_assets/semantic), and the item list is fetched again after 24 h.

### ai2thor

[AI2-THOR](https://ai2thor.allenai.org/) objects, the ProcTHOR, iTHOR and RoboTHOR asset set under CC BY 4.0, read from the [ManiSkill copy](https://huggingface.co/datasets/haosulab/AI2THOR) of the HSSD glTF conversion at a pinned revision. The item id is the AI2-THOR asset name (`import object ai2thor CreditCard_3`). Only the bytes of the requested glTF files are read from the remote archive, and the object type comes from the ProcTHOR asset database. The list holds numbered variants of one object (`Fridge_1`, `Fridge_10`). The [procthor](#procthor) world source imports its furniture through this source.

### openrobotics

[Open Robotics](https://app.gazebosim.org/OpenRobotics/fuel/models) furniture, appliance, kitchen, hospital, office and warehouse models on Gazebo Fuel, only those under CC0 or CC BY 4.0. The item id is the Fuel name with underscores for every run of other characters (`import object openrobotics Dining_Chair`). An item is staged like a [gso](#gso) one and records the model's own license and authors. A model under another license, one that is not a single OBJ or COLLADA mesh, and one the builder would load empty or rescale (a footprint over 5 m) are refused. The item list is fetched again after 24 h.

### simready

[NVIDIA SimReady assets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/simready-assets) on Hugging Face at a pinned revision, about 2.5k household, hospital, warehouse, factory and vehicle part USD models with physics payloads under CC BY 4.0. The item id is the asset folder (`import object simready bed_hospital_standard_a01`). An item fetches its package's metadata and USD layers, checks the CC BY 4.0 license the package states, then fetches only the textures and materials its stage refers to. A footprint over 5 m is refused. The root USD is built with its scene instances realized. The built item keeps the package's SimReady metadata and its PhysX, MuJoCo and Newton physics payloads under `simready/`, which the model formats do not carry, and the download is removed once the item is built.

### simready_dsx

[NVIDIA SimReady AI factory assets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/simready-dsx) on Hugging Face at a pinned revision, today the GB300 rack with its physics, electrical and thermal metadata, under CC BY 4.0 (`import object simready_dsx GB300`). Imported like a [simready](#simready) item.

## Materials

Material sources share one base, `MaterialImporter` in [material.py](src/arena_assets/importers/material.py): a source names the map files of an item (`Maps`: sRGB color, OpenGL normal, linear roughness, metalness and occlusion, or the last three packed as one occlusion-roughness-metalness file) and its description, tags, authors and page, and the base writes the `Common/Material/<name>` item every simulator reads. That item is `<name>.mdl`, an OmniPBR material binding the maps it has, beside `<name>/<name>_BaseColor`, `_N`, `_ORM`, `_R`, `_M` and `_AO` files copied as they came, with the normal map's V tangent unflipped so the OpenGL map is right in Isaac and Gazebo alike. The item goes through the same `db build` as a native material, so `OUT/Common` is a queryable database. A material name is an MDL identifier, a letter followed by letters, digits and underscores, and an item without a color map is refused.

### polyhaven

[Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com/textures) textures under CC0 (`import material polyhaven aerial_asphalt_01`). An item takes the 2k JPEG color, OpenGL normal and packed `arm` maps of a texture, the separate roughness, metalness and occlusion maps where no packed one exists.

### ambientcg

[ambientCG](https://ambientcg.com/) materials under CC0 (`import material ambientcg Metal032`). An item takes the color, OpenGL normal, roughness, metalness and occlusion maps of the material's `2K-JPG` zip.

## Worlds

World sources write `worlds/<name>` in world format 2, which `WorldIdentifier` reads after the `ARENA_WORLD_PATH` roots and before the shipped worlds, so an imported world launches by name (`arena launch world:=procthor_val_0`).

### procthor

[ProcTHOR-10K](https://github.com/allenai/procthor-10k) houses under Apache 2.0, 10k train, 1k val and 1k test. The item id is `<split>/<index>` (`import world procthor val/0`) and the world `procthor_<split>_<index>`: zones named by room type, the walls cut around every door hole, openable doors as `hinged` doors, and the furniture imported through the [ai2thor](#ai2thor) object source and placed as static entities. See [worlds/README.md](../arena_simulation_setup/worlds/README.md#how-worldidentifier-resolves-a-name).

### houseexpo

[HouseExpo](https://github.com/TeaganLi/HouseExpo) floor plans at a pinned revision, 35,126 plans of labeled rooms and walls in one 25 MB archive, downloaded once and indexed in the cache. The item id is the plan id and the world `houseexpo_<plan id>`, with zones from the room boxes clipped to the floor. The repository is MIT licensed and its plans are built on SUNCG, so the verdict is `unclear`. See [worlds/README.md](../arena_simulation_setup/worlds/README.md#how-worldidentifier-resolves-a-name).

### barn

[BARN challenge](https://github.com/Daffan/the-barn-challenge) worlds 0 to 299 under MIT. The item id is the world number (`import world barn 17`) and the world `barn_<index>`, built by the `barn` world generator from the upstream world file, with the challenge start and goal as its scenario. The whole benchmark is the [barn suite](#barn-1).

## Scenarios

Scenario sources write recorded pedestrians as replay scenarios (`human:=replay`, see the [replay adapter](../task_generator/task_generator/simulators/human/README.md#replay-adapter-humanreplay)), each bringing the world it plays in where that is not imported yet. Tracks are resampled to 10 Hz with one `stays:` entry per continuous stay for a path follower.

### eth_ucy

The ETH and UCY pedestrian sequences in [SocNavBench's](https://github.com/CMU-TBD/SocNavBench) copies at a pinned revision. The item id is the sequence, `eth`, `hotel`, `univ`, `zara01` or `zara02` (`import scenario eth_ucy zara01`), and the world's floor is the area the pedestrians walked. zara01 and zara02 share one world. The trajectories carry no license, so the verdict is `unclear`.

### socnavbench

The [SocNavBench](https://github.com/CMU-TBD/SocNavBench) curated episodes on eth, zara01 and zara02, 17 of them, each a replay scenario with the robot start and goal as one `goto` phase in `socnavbench_eth` or `socnavbench_zara` (`import scenario socnavbench <episode>`). The 16 episodes on hotel, univ and the double hotel are refused. The episodes are MIT licensed and the trajectories carry no license, so the verdict is `unclear`. The whole benchmark is the [socnavbench suite](#socnavbench-1).

### juelich

The [Juelich pedestrian dynamics archive](https://ped.fz-juelich.de/da/doku.php) under CC BY 4.0: the BaSiGo 2013 bidirectional corridor and 90 degree crossing and the HERMES 2009 corridors, bottleneck and T-junction. The item id is `<set>/<run>` with set `basigo_bidirectional`, `basigo_crossing_90` or `hermes_<experiment>`, and the world `juelich_<set>_<k>` is one per distinct lab layout of a set, its pillars and inner walls walled in.

### madras

The [MADRAS](https://zenodo.org/records/13830435) TopView sequences of the Fete des Lumieres 2022 in Lyon under CC BY 4.0, dense crowds from one archive (`import scenario madras topview_1a`, up to `topview_2f`). They play in `madras_topview`, an open floor 2 m around every tracked point.

### glow

The [Eindhoven GLOW 2019](https://zenodo.org/records/7007358) crowd recording under CC BY 4.0, cut into 5-minute periods (`import scenario glow <YYYY-mm-ddTHHMM>`). The first import downloads and indexes the 1 GB recording once. The periods play in `glow`, an open floor 2 m around every tracked point.

## Benchmark suites

Suite sources write a suite bundle with its worlds, a contest and a report manifest into the imported root, where they resolve ahead of the shipped ones. See [configs/benchmark/README.md](../arena_evaluation/arena_evaluation/configs/benchmark/README.md) for the stages, contestant rules and metrics.

### barn

The [BARN challenge](https://github.com/Daffan/the-barn-challenge) as one item (`import suite barn barn`): `suites/barn` with one stage per world and the 300 worlds bundled, `contests/barn` with the challenge episode rules, and `manifests/barn`, which tabulates the `barn_score` the challenge's `run.py` computes. Under MIT. See [BARN](../arena_evaluation/arena_evaluation/configs/benchmark/README.md#barn).

### socnavbench

[SocNavBench](https://github.com/CMU-TBD/SocNavBench) as one item (`import suite socnavbench socnavbench`): `suites/socnavbench` with one jackal stage per curated [socnavbench episode](#socnavbench) and its time budget, the two scene worlds bundled, `contests/socnavbench` with SocNavBench's 0.3 m goal margin, and `manifests/socnavbench`. See [SocNavBench](../arena_evaluation/arena_evaluation/configs/benchmark/README.md#socnavbench). The verdict is `unclear`, as for the scenarios.

## Sounds

Sound sources stage each clip as a manifest beside its unchanged wav and build it with `arena-assets db build -t sound` as `Common/Sound/<source>_<item>`. See [configs/sounds/README.md](../arena_simulation_setup/configs/sounds/README.md#imported-sounds) for the manifest values.

### fsd50k

[FSD50K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Fhrozen/FSD50k) clips under CC0 or CC BY 3.0, only those whose AudioSet labels map to a sound kind with a default asset through [fsd50k_kinds.yaml](../arena_simulation_setup/configs/sounds/fsd50k_kinds.yaml). The item id is the Freesound id (`import sound fsd50k <freesound id>`), and the uploader and Freesound URL go into the attribution.

### cmu_arctic

[CMU ARCTIC](http://festvox.org/cmu_arctic/) read speech of the seven speakers awb, bdl, clb, jmk, ksp, rms and slt, about 1,130 utterances each, under the CMU ARCTIC license. The item id is `<voice>_<utterance>` (`import sound cmu_arctic bdl_a0001`), a sound of kind `speech` with the prompt text as `desc` and tags for the voice, gender and accent.

## Recorded episodes

### musohu

[MuSoHu](https://dataverse.orc.gmu.edu/) rosbag1 human navigation runs from the GMU Dataverse under CC0. The item id is the bag name (`import episode musohu <bag>`), and the run becomes `<bag>/episodes/episode_000`, a reference episode of the robot model `human` in the evaluation recorder's layout: scan, odom and cmd_vel on the recorder's topics, every other topic with a ROS 2 type under the robot namespace. A bag missing a needed topic is refused before download. The item list is fetched again after 24 h. See [ingestion/README.md](../arena_evaluation/arena_evaluation/arena_evaluation/ingestion/README.md#files).

## Adding a source

A source subclasses `Importer` (or `MaterialImporter`, or the sound base in `arena_simulation_setup.adapters.sound`), implements `items`, `fetch`, `convert` and `attribution`, and registers an `ImporterMeta` with its kind, source name, `module:Class` target, license verdict, host and description in [importers/__init__.py](src/arena_assets/importers/__init__.py). The module lives in the package that owns the kind it writes, and `default_out` names the root its resolvers read.
