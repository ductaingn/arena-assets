# arena-assets

Build, query, and manage 3D model databases for [Arena](https://github.com/Arena-Rosnav).

`arena-assets` converts datasets of assets (objects, materials, humans, and sounds) into a searchable database: models are converted with Blender, optionally baked with Isaac Sim, and indexed in [ChromaDB](https://www.trychroma.com/) so they can be queried by natural-language description.

## Installation

```sh
pip install ./src
```

Note: if you want to install `arena_assets[build]`, you must use Python 3.11.* (bpy dependency).

The repository is also an `ament_cmake` ROS package; building it in a colcon workspace installs the CLI into a dedicated venv.

## Usage

### Fetch prebuilt assets

```sh
# list available assets
arena-assets net default list

# download assets into a local directory
arena-assets net default fetch -o ./models Common/Material/ABS_Hard_Leather

# only download specific model formats, skip annotations
arena-assets net default fetch -o ./models --format usdz --no-annotation
```

`default` resolves to the public GCS bucket; any other bucket name can be passed instead.

### Build a database

```sh
arena-assets db ./models build -i ./dataset
```

Build options are passed with `-o key=value`:

| option | asset types | effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `formats` | object | comma-separated model formats to export (`*` for all) |
| `previews` | object | render preview images |
| `procthor` | object, material | export a ProcTHOR-compatible `asset-database.json` |
| `bake-mdl` | object | bake embedded MDL materials with Isaac Sim |

Each type is discovered under its own directory of the dataset (`Object`, `Material`, `Human`, `Sound`).

`--overwrite` controls re-building: `skip` (default) keeps existing entries, `overwrite` rebuilds them, `annotations` only refreshes annotations.

### Object lights

An object's `annotation.yaml` may carry `lights:`, one entry per light it emits: `name` (default `light`), `fixture` (`bulb`, `spot`, `downlight`, `panel` or `tube`), `pose` in the frame of the built model as `[[x, y, z], [w, x, y, z]]` or `[[x, y, z], [roll, pitch, yaw]]` (the light emits along the local -z axis of that pose, so `[1, 0, 0, 0]` shines straight down), `lumens`, `cct_K` (default 6500) and, for a spot, `cone_deg`. The build fills it from the lights of the source model (point lights become bulbs, spots keep their cone, area lights become panels or downlights, suns are skipped, 683 lm per Blender watt, color temperature from the light color) unless the source annotation already lists lights, and strips the lights from every exported model, so the annotation is the only place an object's light lives. glTF sources carry point and spot lights, USD sources also carry area lights.

A light may also carry `glow`, the name of the Blender material whose surfaces glow while the light is on. The build gives each extracted light the nearest emissive material: one whose Principled BSDF has a constant, non-black `Emission Color` and an `Emission Strength` above 0 (a textured emission never counts), measured from the light to the center of the bounding box of the faces using the material. Several lights may share one material, and an emissive material nearest to no light is left as it is. A hand-annotated `glow` must name a material used by the model, otherwise the build of that object fails with the list of its materials. Glow materials ship dark: their emission is cleared in every exported format, and the simulator lights them with the lamp. In the SDF export each glow material is a visual of its own, `glow_<material>` with the mesh `<name>.glow_<i>.dae` (`i` counts the glow materials in sorted name order), next to `visual` with the remaining faces in `<name>.dae`. A glow visual carries a `<material>` with the base color as `ambient` and `diffuse` and a black `specular` and `emissive`, unless the base color is textured.

### Sound assets

A sound asset is a directory `Sound/<Name>/` holding its wav files and a `<Name>.yaml` manifest (version 2: `kind`, `level_db`, `loop`, `variants`, optional `desc` and `tags`). The manifest is the only annotation source: the build derives `annotation.yaml` from it (tags are the manifest tags, every variant's tags, and the kind) and fails on a manifest with the wrong version or without `kind`, `level_db` or `variants`.

```sh
arena-assets db ./sounds build -t sound -i ./dataset
arena-assets db ./sounds query sound "robot motor hum" --filter "level_db>50"
arena-assets db ./sounds query sound "steps on wood" --filter "kind=footstep" -n 3
```

`kind`, `loop`, `level_db`, and the comma-joined variant ids are stored as metadata.

### Upload a built database

```sh
arena-assets net my-bucket author ./models -d Common
```

Files already present in the bucket with the same size are skipped. Uploading requires write access to the bucket: a token is taken from `--token`, the `GCS_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable, or `gcloud auth print-access-token`, in that order.

### Query

```sh
# best match (prints the asset path)
arena-assets db ./models query material "light brown wood"

# top 5 matches with distance scores
arena-assets db ./models query object "office chair" -n 5 --scores

# constrain by size (width/depth/height/volume in meters, repeatable)
arena-assets db ./models query object "office chair" --filter "height<1.0" --filter "volume>0.05"

# list everything of a type
arena-assets db ./models list material
```

All logs and progress bars go to stderr; stdout only carries the results, so output can be piped.

## If your materials are missing in the output model

USD files can contain embedded MDL materials, which need to be baked before Blender can bake them correctly.
You can specify `-o bake-mdl=/path/to/isaacsim/python.sh` to enable automatic baking of MDL materials during database build.
Specifying `-o bake-mdl` without a path uses a docker image from the [Nvidia nvcr registry](https://nvcr.io/nvidia/isaac-sim). (May not work consistently.)

## Development

```sh
pip install "./src[test]"
pre-commit install

pytest tests/
ruff check . && ruff format src
